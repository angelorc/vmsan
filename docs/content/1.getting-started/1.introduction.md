vmsan is a Firecracker microVM sandbox toolkit that lets you create, manage, and connect to isolated microVMs from the command line.

## What is vmsan?

vmsan wraps [Firecracker](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker) to provide a simple CLI for spinning up lightweight, security-isolated virtual machines. Each VM runs inside a jailer with its own network namespace, seccomp filters, and cgroup resource limits. A Go-based agent inside the VM exposes an HTTP API for shell access, file operations, and command execution.

## What you can do

- **Manage the full VM lifecycle** - Create, start, stop, and remove microVMs with simple commands
- **Isolate network access** - Use allow-all, deny-all, or custom policies with domain and CIDR allowlists
- **Connect interactively** - Open a shell to any running VM via WebSocket PTY
- **Transfer files** - Upload and download files without SSH
- **Use Docker images** - Build root filesystems from any Docker or OCI image with `--from-image`
- **Choose your runtime** - Pick from `base`, `node22`, or `python3.13`
- **Script everything** - Get structured JSON output with the `--json` flag

## When to use vmsan

Use vmsan when you need to:

- Run untrusted code in an isolated sandbox
- Create disposable development environments
- Test software across different runtimes
- Provide isolated compute environments for CI/CD or multi-tenant workloads
