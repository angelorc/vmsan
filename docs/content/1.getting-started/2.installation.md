## Prerequisites

- Linux (x86_64 or aarch64) with KVM support
- [Bun](https://bun.sh) >= 1.2
- [Go](https://go.dev) >= 1.22 (to build the in-VM agent)
- Root/sudo access (required for TAP networking and jailer)
- `squashfs-tools` (for rootfs conversion during install)

## Install Firecracker, kernel, and rootfs

Run the install script to download Firecracker, a Linux kernel, and the Ubuntu 24.04 root filesystem into `~/.vmsan/`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angelorc/vmsan/main/install.sh | bash
```

This installs:
- Firecracker + Jailer (latest release)
- Linux kernel (vmlinux 6.1)
- Ubuntu 24.04 rootfs (converted from squashfs to ext4)

## Install the vmsan CLI

::code-group
```bash [bun]
bun add -g vmsan
```

```bash [npm]
npm install -g vmsan
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add -g vmsan
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn global add vmsan
```
::

## Build the in-VM agent

The Go agent runs inside each VM and handles shell access, file operations, and command execution:

```bash
cd agent
make install
cd ..
```

## Verify the installation

```bash
vmsan --help
```

You should see a list of available commands.

::tip
You can also link a local development build globally by running `bun link` from the project root.
::

## Uninstall

To remove Firecracker, the kernel, and rootfs from `~/.vmsan/`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angelorc/vmsan/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --uninstall
```
