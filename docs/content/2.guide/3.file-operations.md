vmsan lets you transfer files to and from running VMs without SSH.

## Upload a file

Copy a local file into a running VM:

```bash
vmsan upload <vm-id> ./local-file.txt /remote/path/file.txt
```

The file is sent to the in-VM agent over HTTP.

## Download a file

Copy a file from a running VM to your local machine:

```bash
vmsan download <vm-id> /remote/path/file.txt ./local-file.txt
```

## Use cases

- Deploy application code into a sandboxed VM
- Extract logs or build artifacts from a running VM
- Stage configuration files before starting a service
